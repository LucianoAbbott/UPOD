 		<h3 id = "projectSummary">1.1 Project Summary</h3>
  			<h4 id="purpose">1.1.1 Purpose, Scope, and Objectives</h4>
  			<p>UPOD (University Online Physics Database) is software designed for students to access physics information, equations and diagrams as well as for professors to add, edit and remove those components. The scope is Wilfrid Laurier University and the objective is to create software that is easy to use for both students and professors alike. The finished version of UPOD will be delivered to David Brown who will also monitor and critique each stage of the development process. A more detailed overview can be found on the project's Requirements document.</p>
  
  			<h4 id="assumptions">1.1.2 Assumptions and Constraints</h4> 
  			<p>The project is to be completed by December 4th, 2017. The constraints include working around various group members' schedules to communicate effectively and fulfil tasks on time. It is assumed that all work will be completed by each deadline, and to further ensure such goals, deadlines will be set earlier than their official posting to facilitate time for necessary modifications and SQA testing. Budget is not a factor in this project.</p>
  
  			<h4 id="projectDeliverables">1.1.3 Project Deliverables</h4> 
  			<p>The project (UPOD) will be delivered to the acquirer (David Brown). The project will consist of a requirements document, a project management document, designs, specifications, a user manual, documentation, work logs, source code, and all other documents and work that went into the project.</p>

	<h2 id="managerialPlan">5. Managerial Process Plans</h2>

 		<h3 id="startupPlan">5.1 Startup Plans</h3>
 
 	 		<h4 id="estimationPlan">5.1.1 Estimation Plan</h4>
  	 		<p>The client determines the final project deadline along with several major milestones. However, the methods and work required to meet a given deadline are estimated using prior experience as a reference for time consumption. It is therefore expected that dates and deadlines will be moderately tentative.</p>
   
   			<h4 id="staffingPlan">5.1.2 Staffing Plan</h4>
    			<p>All members of the project are students from the Fall 2017 class CP317. No additional staff will be required or considered.</p>
    
   			<h4 id="resourceAcquisitionPlan">5.1.3 Resource Acquisition Plan</h4>
    			<p>As part of the requirements phase, monetary resources are not applicable due to an established budget of $0.</p>
  
  		<h3 id="workPlan">5.2 Work Plan</h3>
  
   			<h4 id="workActivities">5.2.1 Work Activities</h4>
   			<p>Work activities will be determined in greater detail once the project's requirements and design frameworks near their completion. It is however assumed that each individual working on the project will spend an average of five hours a week performing these work activities, with a natural increase in time spent to ten hours a week as the final deadline approaches.</p>
    
    			<h4 id="scheduleAllocation">5.2.2 Schedule Allocation</h4>
     			<p>Scheduling will be determined by consensus within smaller, more specialized groups, such that they conform to the broader dates agreed upon by the client. The basics of the schedule will be kept in section 1.1.4 of this document, with frequent reminders given to the members of the project.</p>
     
    		<h3 id="controlPlan">5.3 Control Plan</h3>
    
     			<h4 id="requirementsControlPlan">5.3.1 Requirements Control Plan</h4>
      			<p>A combination of group consensus and client requests will decide changes to the requirements. All major changes to the requirements will necessitate approval from the client, while minor changes will only require consensus from affected group members.</p>
      
      			<h4 id="scheduleControlPlan">5.3.2 Schedule Control Plan</h4>
       			<p>Milestones and schedules will be laid out well before the deadline. Failures to meet said deadlines will lead to comprehensive inspections to determine if the initial schedule is still possible, and to take into account any relevant changes into future schedules. All deadlines will take into consideration the time requirements of their corresponding quality assurance counterparts, whenever reasonable and applicable to do so.</p>
       
       			<h4 id="qualityControlPlan">5.3.4 Quality Control Plan</h4>
        		<p>To ensure unbiased objectivity in testing, quality assurance testers are nonparticipants in the completed tasks they are examining. In manners as they see fit, quality assurance testers will demonstrate their thorough analyses for any flaws, faults, and thus avenues of improvement.</p>
        
        		<h4 id="reportingPlan">5.3.5 Reporting Plan (subject to change)</h4>
         		<p>Quality assurance testers who find any mistakes, defects, or bugs, will publish their findings in either the inbuilt tools of the repository GitHub, or in document-specific quality assurance spreadsheets (as applicable) to formalize the testing process.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2 id="technicalProcessPlan">6. Technical Process Plans</h2>
	<p>This project management plan will detail 4 outlines: the Process Model, the Methods, Tools and Techniques, the Infrastructure Plan, and the Product Acceptance Plan.</p>

  		<h3 id="processModel">6.1 Process Model</h3>
    		<p>Development of the product from its beginning to final stages is divided into an incrementally contiguous series of phases, each succeeding the other in their relative aspects, converging steadily over time towards the completion of the product and the fulfilment of the due date.</p>
		
		<ul>
    		<li>Phase 1: [Introductory Phase] Delineation of group tasks and forming central repository for all project-related files.</li>
	    	<li>Phase 2: [Requirements Phase] Completion of Project Management Plan and Requirements Plan.</li>
    		<li>Phase 3: [Design Phase] Initiation of group tasks and prospecting project's front-end and back-end features.</li>
    		<li>Phase 4: [Implementation Phase] Development of project's front-end and back-end.</li>
    		<li>Phase 5: [Integration Phase] Consolidation of all of project faculties into one singular cohesive product.</li>
		</ul>

  		<h3 id="methods">6.2 Methods, Tools, and Techniques</h3>
    		<p>At this stage in the product's development, it is yet to be anticipated in great detail precisely what development techniques will be used. However, the clearest approximation that can be made now are those languages that are best suited to the needs of the implementation teams, catering to the requirements of both the product's front-end and back-end. Enacting a final decision on which languages will be used while still in the preliminary stages of the product's development [namely its design stage] may negatively affect implementation.</p>

  		<h3 id="infrastructurePlan">6.3 Infrastructure Plan</h3>
    		<p>Each member of the project team has access to personal computers, as well as access to computers in the campus of Wilfrid Laurier University. For the centralization of all project-related data, files, and code, the project team will collectively contribute to a singular GitHub repository. In addition, a collaborative workspace on the website "slack.com" has been created to streamline communication between members of the project team.</p>

  		<h3 id="productAcceptancePlan">6.4 Product Acceptance Plan</h3>
    		<p>To ensure the quality of all stages of the product's development, from design to implementation to integration, the project team will include formations of SQA to review, refine, advise, debug, and document the product's components. Software Quality Assurance groups will play a significant role in the improvements of each successive version of the project.</p>
</div>

<div>

	<h2 id="supportingProcessPlan">7. Supporting Process Plans</h2>
 	<p>This project management plan will discuss the following supporting process plans: the configuration management plan, verification and validation plan, documentation plan, quality assurance plan, reviews and audits plan, problem resolution plan, and the process improvement plan.</p>
 
 		<h3 id="configurationPlan">7.1 Configuration Management Plan</h3>
		<p>The configuration of the project UPOD will be systematized through its own stages of development and the documents that guide them, to be realized through the required components to successively build them. For example, use of the "Requirements" document contributes to how project organization can be tabulated [among each team member] and thus operationalized [among the team as a whole], in which adhering chiefly to the objectives of the project helps to eliminate any misunderstandings of its implementation.</p>
	
 		<h3 id="verificationPlan">7.2 Verification and Validation Plan</h3>
 		<p>All verification and validation is done using the GIT version control system. The repository hosted on GitHub keeps track of the changes and contributions each member makes towards their respective tasks.</p>
 
 		<h3 id="documentationPlan">7.3 Documentation Plan</h3>
 		<p>All phases of the project must be documented. GitHub itself will assist in this by recording who did what, while the rest will be documented in a variety of means. Such means may involve a group-led tracking catalogue to monitor each member's contributions, if applicable, to procure a system of healthy engagement to the project's documentation [and to the project as a whole].</p>
 
 		<h3 id="qualityAssurancePlan">7.4 Quality Assurance Plan</h3>
 		<p>SQA teams will review and report on all phases of development, highlighting areas of improvement that the team working on the actual component will fix. Proposals of revised content are encouraged for all aspects of the project and concerns shared among authors of such components.</p>
 
 		<h3 id="reviewsAndAudits">7.5 Reviews and Audits</h3>
 		<p>SQA groups will review and audit their assigned sections.</p>
 
 		<h3 id="problemResolutionPlan">7.6 Problem Resolution Plan</h3>
 		<p>Any problems that may arise are settled democratically by ways of polling and surveying the most supported outcome. For instance, time conflicts and meetings will be decided by a vote, and the time with the highest number of votes will be selected as representative of the group majority.</p>
 
	 	<h3 id="processImprovementPlan">7.7 Process Improvement Plan</h3>
 		<p>Formulation of the process improvement plan should occur post-integration phase, when the team and its members have a more comprehensive understanding and experience of how the project UPOD has moved through the various processes of project development.</p>
