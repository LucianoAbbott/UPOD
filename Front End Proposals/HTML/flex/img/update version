Motio.  In physics, motion is a description of the position of an object over time. Motion may be described in terms of displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, time and speed. Motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame. 
Laws of motion:  
First law: In an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force.
Second law: In an inertial reference frame, the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: F = ma.
Third law:  When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.                         
Two common types of motion below:

Translational Motion is motion that involves the sliding of an object in one or more of the three dimensions: x, y or z. Example: the motion of a bullet fired from a gun. Here we talk about constant translational acceleration in a straight line.
Since the position, velocity, and acceleration are collinear (parallel, and lie on the same line) – only the magnitudes of these vectors are necessary, and because the motion is along a straight line, the problem effectively reduces from three dimensions to one.
 u: the initial velocity;  v: the final velocity;  a: acceleration;  t:time;  s: final position
The object’s final velocity is described as below:                                                                      
            v= u + a*t
The object’s final position is:
	         s=u*t+ 1/2*a*t^2
The relationship between initial velocity and final velocity is 
	        v^2-u^2=2*a*s
The distance the object traveled can also be computed by average velocity times time:
           s= 1/2(u+v)*t
           
Uniform Circular Motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. We talk about uniform here, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed.The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of a mass of a body.  
Examples: an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at a constant height, a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track and so on.

There are some basic formulas of uniform circular motion
 r: a circle of radius; T: period for one rotation;  v: speed of the object traveling the circle;  ω: the angular rate of rotation, also known as angular velocity. a: acceleration
For motion in a circle of radius r, the circumference of the circle C can be computed as below
            C=2*π*r ( C: circumference of the circle)
If the period for one rotation is T, the angular rate of rotation, also known as angular velocity, ω is:
            ω= 2*π/T  (units are radians/second)
The speed of the object traveling the circle is:
            v=2*π*r/T= ω*r
The angle θ swept out in a time t is:
            θ=2*π*t/T= ω*t 
The acceleration due to change in the direction is:
            a= v^2/r = ω^2*r
