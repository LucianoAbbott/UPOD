Translational Motion is motion that involves the sliding of an object in one or more of the three dimensions: x, y or z. 
 u: the initial velocity;  v: the final velocity;  a: acceleration;  t:time;  s:displacement                                 
	1.	v= u + a*t
	2.	s=ut+ 1/2*a*t^2
	3.	v^2-u^2=2*a*s

Uniform Circular Motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. 
We talk about uniform here, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed.
  r: a circle of radius; T: period for one rotation;  v: speed of the object traveling the circle; 
  ω: the angular rate of rotation, also known as angular velocity. a: acceleration
	1.	C=2*π*r ( C: circumference of the circle)
	2.	ω= 2*π/T
	3.	v=2*π*r/T= ω*r
	4.	θ=2*π*t/T= ω*t (The angle θ swept out in a time t )
	5.	a= v^2/r = ω^2*r
