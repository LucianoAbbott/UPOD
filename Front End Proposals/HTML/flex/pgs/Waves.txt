< Definition of Wave >
A wave can be described as a disturbance that transfers energy from one point to another through a medium. The medium itself doesn’t make the wave; it simply carries the wave from its source to other points. For example, in the case of water wave in the ocean, the ocean water is the medium of the water wave.
Waves are consisted of oscillations or vibrations around almost fixed locations. A disturbance creates the oscillations that are perpendicular to the propagation of energy transfer.

< Categories of Waves >
There are several different kinds of waves, and some waves can be distinguished from other based on their characteristics.
1. Longitudinal Waves vs. Transverse Waves vs. Surface Waves
Waves can be categorized according to the direction of displacement of the medium. There are three main types of waves based on it: longitudinal waves, transverse waves, and surface waves.

Longitudinal waves are waves that the displacement of the medium is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. Suppose that a slinky is stretched out from end to end. Then, a wave can be introduced into the slinky by vibrating the first coil back and forth horizontally. When the first coil of the slinky is repeatedly vibrated, a disturbance is created which travels through the slinky from one end to the other. In this case, the particles of the medium move parallel to the direction that the pulse moves. Sound waves in air are good examples of longitudinal waves.

Transverse waves are waves that the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. Suppose that a slinky is stretched out in a horizontal direction. Then, a wave can be introduced into the slinky by vibrating the first coil up and down vertically. When the first coil of the slinky is repeatedly vibrated, a disturbance is created which travels through the slinky from one end to the other. In this case, the particles of the medium move perpendicular to the direction that the pulse moves. Transverse waves may occur on a string, on the surface of a liquid, and throughout a solid. Transverse waves cannot propagate in a gas or a liquid because there is no mechanism for driving motion perpendicular to the propagation of the wave.

Surface waves are waves that propagate along the interface between differing media. The particles at the surface of the medium undergo a circular motion, and the motion of particles tends to decrease as one proceeds further from the surface. Surface waves are sometimes referred to as circular waves since particles of the medium undergo a motion in a complete circle.

2. Electromagnetic Waves vs. Mechanical Waves
Instead of the direction of displacement, waves can also be categorized according to their ability or disability to transmit energy through a vacuum (empty space). There are two main types of waves based on it: electromagnetic waves, and mechanical waves

Electromagnetic waves are waves that are capable of transmitting its energy through a vacuum. The vibration of charged particles creates a wave which has both an electric and a magnetic component, and this wave is the electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves are used to transmit long/short/FM wavelength radio waves, and TV/telephone/wireless signals or energies. All light waves are examples of electromagnetic waves.

Mechanical waves are waves that are not capable of transmitting its energy through a vacuum. Mechanical waves, unlike the electromagnetic waves, require the presence of a material medium in order to transport their energy from one location to another. Sound waves are examples of mechanical waves.

< Mathematical of Waves >
1. Frequency and Period of a Wave
f: the frequency of a wave that the number of cycles per second
==> f = 1/T
T: the period of a wave that the number of seconds per cycle
==> T = 1/f

2. Velocity of a Wave
v: the velocity of a wave that the distance(d) traveled by a wave crest in a given interval of time(t)
==> v = d/t
