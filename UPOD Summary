Challenges we faced:

We had trouble getting all the group members together with our varying schedules. There were also issues with getting the JSON to communicate
with the data in the back-end.   //I don't know if this is even accurate, someone from back-end confirm
There were also issues with getting the front-end HTML working with all browsers, as it seems like FireFox rendered the top bar beside
the body rather than above it.

How we could improve:

As the project went on certain individuals emerged as being more experienced with certain aspects (such as HTML and JavaScript). It
might have been helpful to assign these people as leaders earlier on in the cycle so they could better dictate just exactly how we
would do things, rather than the laissez-faire style employed in the early stages.
