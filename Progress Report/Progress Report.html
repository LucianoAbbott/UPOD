	<div>
        <h3 id="Overview">Overview</h3>

        <p>The Undergraduate Online Physics Database [UPOD] is an online repository of data designed for students to access physics information, equations, and diagrams to help them in furthering their educations in their university careers. The information on UPOD is added, edited, and removed by moderators and administrators that are approved to do so, where moderator are assumed to be teaching assistants and administrators are assumed to be professors. This report will give a short summary of what was completed, when it was completed, and what remains uncompleted. </p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="SPMP">Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)</h3>

        <p>The software project management plan outlines the scheduling, budget, and staffing of the project, as well as what it aims to accomplish. The SPMP, and its corresponding SQA, was completed on time, on September 27th, 2017, with modifications as necessary to reflect any changes in the project as a whole, or to improve the document's functionality [such as hyperlinking with other documents, or a navigation bar to readily access any section of the document; elements were added, edited, or removed entirely.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="Requirements">Requirements Document</h3>

        <p>The requirements document outlines the broad structures and capabilities of UPOD, in terms of functionality and design. The requirements document and its corresponding SQA analysis was completed on time with minor changes done throughout the project's development as necessitated; elements were added, edited, or removed entirely.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="Analysis">Analysis Document</h3>

        <p>The analysis document provides a more in-depth interpretation of the project beyond the initial requirements phase, and acts as a basis for the design document as well as for the project. The class diagram, use case diagram, and sequence diagrams were used in conjunction with object-oriented design to establish a starting point for project implementation. This document [and its corresponding SQA analysis] was completed on time, on September 27th, 2017, with minor changes done throughout the project's development as necessitated; elements were added, edited, or removed entirely.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="Design">Design Document</h3>

        <p>The design document provides a comprehensive illustration of the design and setup of the UPOD application. This document and its corresponding SQA analysis was completed on time, with minor changes done through the project development as certain; elements were added, edited, or removed entirely.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="Implementation">Implementation</h3>

        <p>The implementation of the project was divided into two sections, front-end and back-end, with about half of the members of the group belonging to each. The front-end team was responsible for the design and programming of the user interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The back-end team was involved with storing data in a database using JDBC, and manipulating data using Java.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="Completion">Completion</h3>

        <p>The project was not completed as originally intended, although many features were found to be working and functional to the degree that they were specified. The front-end HTML pages are complete, while the underlying JavaScript used to make these pages interactive was close to completion [as seen on the edit page]. The JSON was also close to demonstrative functionality. The back-end were able to build and complete a majority of their components (such as the search, page storage, retrieval and deletion) but not enough to fully interact with the front end. Essentially a large number of working or almost working parts, although we were unable to thoroughly consolidate these parts into one.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="Challenges">Challenges We Faced</h3>

        <p>We had trouble getting all the group members together with our varying schedules. There were also issues with getting the JSON to communicate with the data in the back-end. There were also issues with getting the front-end HTML working with all browsers, for example, it seemed like FireFox rendered the top search bar beside the body rather than above it, on every page that had it in the header.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="Improve">Future Improvement</h3>

        <p>As the project went on, certain individuals emerged as being more experienced with certain aspects [such as HTML and JavaScript]. It might have been helpful to assign these people as leaders earlier on in the development processes so they could better express just exactly how we would do things, as opposed than the laissez-faire style employed in the early stages.</p>
