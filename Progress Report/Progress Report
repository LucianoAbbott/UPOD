UPOD Progress Report

Overview

The Undergraduate Online Physics Database is an online repository of data designed for students to access physics information, 
equations and diagrams to help aid them in furthering their educations in their university careers. 
The information on UPOD added, edited and removed by moderators and administrators that are approved to do so. 
This is given with the assumption that moderator are Teaching Assistants and administrators are Professors.  
This report will give a short summary of what was complete, when it was completed and what still needs to be finished.


Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)

The software project management plan is document which outlines, at its core, budget, staffing and the project schedule. 
It outlines what the project it to accomplish, each sections of the project, and budget, staffing and the schedule for each project section. 
The SPMP, and its corresponding SQA, was completed on time, on September 27th, 
with minor changes done through the project development as certain, elements were added, edited or removed entirely.

Requirements Document

The requirements document is a document which outlines what the UPOD is capable of doing, in terms of functionality and design. 
How it functions, how methods function and other such information that outlines the structure of UPOD. 
The requirements document, and its corresponding SQA, was completed on time, 
with minor changes done through the project development as certain, elements were added, edited or removed entirely.

Analysis Document

The analysis document is a document that provides an in-depth analysis of the project beyond the initial requirements phase. 
It acts as a basis for the design document as well as for the project. 
The class, use case, and sequence diagrams are used in conjunction with object-oriented design to establish a starting point 
for project implementation. This document and its corresponding SQA, was completed on time, on September 27th, 
with minor changes done through the project development as certain, elements were added, edited or removed entirely.

Design Document

The design document is a document that explains the projects design and setup of the UPOD application. 
This document and its corresponding SQA, was completed on time, with minor changes done through the project development as certain, 
elements were added, edited or removed entirely.
