implementation of the project was divided into two sections- front and back end
with about half of the group </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>belonging to
each. The front-end was responsible for the design and programming of the user
interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>The back-end
involved storing data in a database using JDBC, and manipulating data using

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>The project was
not completed as originally intended, however we did get many things working
and working quite well. The front-end</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>HTML pages are
complete, while the underlying JavaScript used to make these pages interactive
was close to completion (as seen</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>on the edit
page). The JSON was also close to working. The back-end managed to get a lot of
their stuff complete (such as the </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>search, page
storage, retrieval and deletion) but not enough to fully interact with the
front end. Essentially there are lots of </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>working or almost
working parts, we just weren't quite able to put it all together.</span></p>

faced</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>We had trouble
getting all the group members together with our varying schedules. There were
also issues with getting the JSON to</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>communicate with
the data in the back-end. There were also issues with getting the front-end
HTML working with all browsers, for</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>example, it
seemed like FireFox rendered the top search bar beside the body rather than
above it, on every page that had it in</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>How we could
improve</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>As the project
went on certain individuals emerged as being more experienced with certain
aspects (such as HTML and JavaScript). It</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>might have been
helpful to assign these people as leaders earlier on in the cycle so they could
better dictate just exactly how </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>we would do
things, rather than the laissez-faire style employed in the early stages.</span></p>
