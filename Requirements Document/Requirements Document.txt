UPOD Software Requirements

1. Introduction

UPOD is a web application that is designed to make the access of information, from the physics database, easier and more efficient for students. It will allow professors to customize topic pages by adding equations, explanations, definitions, and interactive diagrams. Professors will also be able to access the physics database itself, and update the stored information.

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to display the required components that are required to make application. It is designed so that any users or developers who read it will leave with a strong understanding of the application. 

1.2 Scope

UPOD is an online physics database targeted at university students and professors. The application's UI is designed to allow for easy access and updating. UPOD will give students the ability to explore multiple physics topics, through the use of interactive diagrams, pictures, videos, equations, definitions, and explanations. Professors will be able to add to the studentsâ€™ learning experience by creating and editing topic pages.
The goal for UPOD is to make it easily accessible to the students and professors, through the Laurier Single Sign on system. 

1.3 Definitions

Front-end: The section of the website, created by the front-end programmers, made up of programming languages. This section will be how the user access info from the database.

Back-end: The section of the website that sends info from the database to the front-end.

UPOD: The Undergraduate Physics Online Database.

UI: User Interface. The portion of the website that will interact with the general users.

HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The portion of front-end code that creates the structure of the application.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets. The portion of the front-end code that makes the application for aesthetically pleasing.

Web Application: A program which is accessed over the internet.

1.5 Overview

This document provides an in-depth reference for the software specifications of UPOD. It begins with an introduction and goes on to
describe the characteristics, functions, and design of the project. An overview of the requirements follows, with appendices and an
index ending the document.

2. Overall Description



2.1 Product Perspective

The UPOD site is to be self contained supplying its own front and back end. However, UPOD will be integrated into a Laurier Service as to utilize the Single Sign On authentication service provided by idp.wlu.ca.
UPOD will host full support for the following browsers
	- Firefox 28
	- Chrome 21
	- Safari 6.1
	- Opera 12.1
	- MS Edge 11
And partial support for
	- Internet Explorer 10
	- iOS Safari 7.1
	- Android Browser 4.4
	- Samsung Internet 5
UPOD's user interface will run almost exclusively for desktop computers with some, to no, support for mobile browsers. This is primarely because of non resizable elements such as animated and interactable diagrams that will be too large for mobile interfaces.
UPOD's user interface will contain a search bar, for finding relevent pages; a drop down menu, for secondary site functions such as the moderators panel and about; and a table of contents, consiting of links for navigating each individual pages sections.
UPOD will require a database, to hold information; a server, for generating pages and fufilling user requests; and a browser, for viewing the site.



2.2 Product Functions

2.3 User Characteristics

2.3 User Characteristics

General User  - While UPOD is targeted at university students, a general user is not required to have physics education or experience.
It is assumed that they have basic technical knowledge and can navigate a website. They are able to traverse, read, and suggest new
pages without creating an account.

Moderator - A moderator has all of the privileges of a general user. They also require an account, which can be used to create, update,
edit, and delete pages. Moderators should have a basic knowledge of physics and greater technical knowledge than a general user, as they
have a greater degree of control over the website. Programming knowledge is not mandatory, however, if they wish to create an
interactive diagram, the moderator must know javascript.

Administrator - An administrator has all moderator privileges, and can add moderators and administrators to the existing list. They also
require an account, and should have the greatest degrees of physics knowledge and technical experience.

2.4 Constraints

Due to a lack of resources, UPOD will be unable to implement a separate mobile browser, causing the website not to be as functional off 
desktop browsers.

2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

The assumption is that the general user will be accessible to anyone, where as the administrators and moderators will access from 
idp.wlu.ca to edit, create, delete and update pages. By having access to idp.wlu.ca, it will not require UPOD to create a separate 
database or hashing or encrypting passwords.
