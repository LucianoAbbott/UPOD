        <p> UPOD (Undergraduate Physics Online Database) is an online physics database, being a means of storing and retrieving information. Students no longer need to worry about searching through multiple sites to attain accurate information on physics. UPOD provides a single access point for all undergraduate-level physics information.</p>


        <h3 id = "purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements for UPOD as a database and a website. It is an overview of the scope and functions of the project for UPOD's client, development team, and any other interested parties. </p>

        <h3 id = "scope">1.2 Scope</h3>
        <p>UPOD is an online physics database targeted at undergraduate students. However, anyone with internet access may use UPOD. The UPOD website connects to a database of physics information. It displays this information via a series of web pages, each page providing information on a different physics topic. The website allows all users to search the database and read pages. Moderators and administrators have the ability to create, update, and delete pages. UPOD increases the efficiency of obtaining physics information, as it eliminates the need to search multiple websites by providing a central location for all undergraduate physics topics.</p>

        <p>This document provides a reference for the software specifications of UPOD. It begins with an introduction and goes on to describe the characteristics, functions, and design of the

        <p>UPOD is a self-contained website based on the functionality of a physics encyclopedia. Therefore, UPOD supplies users with information they request in regards to physics. The goal is to make UPOD intuitive to the user 
            through the use of known heuristics in user interface (UI) design, and to make the website easier to use then other physics databases. To ensure the website is informative, moderators [ie. the writers for the site], 
            can add, delete, and edit pages and information in the database, while administrators [ie. the managers of the moderators], can promote and revoke moderator status.</p>

        <h3 id = "productPerspective">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
        <p>The UPOD website is self-contained supplying its own front-end and back-end. However, UPOD is a Laurier Service and can utilize the Single Sign On authentication service 
            provided by idp.wlu.ca for moderator and administrator login only. UPOD hosts full support for
            the following browsers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firefox 28</li>
            <li>Chrome 21</li>
            <li>Safari 6.1</li>
            <li>Opera 12.1</li>
            <li>MS Edge 11</li>
        </ul>
        <p>UPOD's user interface (UI) is designed exclusively for desktop machines with little to no consideration for mobile usability.</p>
