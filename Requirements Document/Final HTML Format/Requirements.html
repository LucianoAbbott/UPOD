        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p> UPOD (Undergraduate Physics Online Database) is an online physics database, being a means of storing and retrieving information. Students no longer need to worry about searching through multiple sites to attain accurate information on physics. UPOD provides single access point for all undergraduate-level physics information.</p>


        <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements for UPOD as a database and a website. It is an overview of the scope and functions of the project for UPOD's client, development team, and any other interested parties. </p>

        <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>
        <p>UPOD is an online physics database targeted at undergraduate students. However, anyone with internet access may use UPOD. The UPOD website connects to a database of physics information. It displays this information via a series of web pages, each page providing information on a different physics topic. The website allows all users to search the database and read pages. Moderators and administrators have the ability to create, update, and delete pages. UPOD increases the efficiency of obtaining physics information, as it eliminates the need to search multiple websites by providing a central location for all undergraduate physics topics.</p>

        <h3>1.4 References</h3>
        <p>IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications, IEEE Std 830-1998, IEEE, New York, NY, 1998.</p>
        <h3>1.5 Overview</h3>
        <p>This document provides a reference for the software specifications of UPOD. It begins with an introduction and goes on to describe the characteristics, functions, and design of the
            project. An overview of the requirements follows, with appendices
            and an index ending the document. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p>UPOD is a self-contained website based on the functionality of a physics encyclopedia. Therefore, UPOD supplies users with information they request in regards to physics. The goal is to make UPOD intuitive to the user 
            through the use of known heristics in user interface (UI) design, and to make the website easier to use then other physics databases. To ensure the website is informative, moderators, in this case writers for the site, 
            can add, delete and edit pages and information in the database while administrators, the manager of the moderators, can promote and revoke moderator status.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
        <p>The UPOD website is self contained supplying its own front-end and back-end. However, UPOD is a Laurier Service and can utilize the Single Sign On authentication service 
            provided by idp.wlu.ca for moderator and admin login only. UPOD hosts full support for
            the following browsers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firefox 28</li>
            <li>Chrome 21</li>
            <li>Safari 6.1</li>
            <li>Opera 12.1</li>
            <li>MS Edge 11</li>
        </ul>
        <p>UPOD's user interface (UI) is designed exclusively for desktop machines with little to no consideration for mobile usability.</p>
        <h3>2.2 Define Product Functions</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Navigation</dt>
            <dd>UPOD is navigable using a series of categorical links and a search bar. Categorical based navigation is based on a hierarchical tree structure implemented by assigning categories to pages.</dd>
            <dt>Search</dt>
            <dd>UPOD has a search algorithm to find and index key terms from the title and body of articles. Key terms are compared to the frequency of word use and if under a certain threshold are indexed.</dd>
            <dt>Pages </dt>
            <dd>Pages have a title, categories, sections, sub sections, formulas, and diagrams. </dd>
            <dt>Moderator Functions</dt>
            <dd>Moderators can create, delete and edit pages. </dd>
            <dt>Administrator Functions</dt>
            <dd>Administrators can promote, and revoke moderator status to and from user status.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>General Users</dt>
            <dd>While UPOD is targeted at university students, a general user is not required to have physics education or experience. It is assumed that a general user has basic technical 
                knowledge and can navigate a website. They are able to traverse the website and read pages
                without creating an account.</dd>
            <dt>Moderators</dt>
            <dd>A moderator has all of the privileges of a general user. They also require an account, which can be used to create, update, edit, and delete pages. Moderators should have a 
                basic knowledge of physics and greater technical knowledge than a
                general user, as they have a greater degree of control over the website. Programming knowledge is not mandatory, however, if a moderator wishes to create an interactive 
                diagram, they must know JavaScript.</dd>
            <dt>Administrators</dt>
            <dd>An administrator has all moderator privileges, and can add moderators and administrators to the pre-existing list of moderators and administrators. Administrators also require an account, and should 
                have the greatest degrees of physics knowledge
                and technical experience.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>2.4 Constraints</h3>
        <p>Due to the interactive and technical nature of the front-end, the website does not have an exclusive interface for mobile devices. </p>

        <h3>2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>The assumption is that the general user is accessible to anyone, where as the administrators and moderators have access from idp.wlu.ca to edit, create, delete and 
            update pages. By having access to idp.wlu.ca, it does not require UPOD to
            create a separate database for hashing and / or encrypting passwords.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>3. Specific Requirements </h2>

        <h3>3.1 External Interface Requirements </h3>
        <p>UPOD will have no external interface to rely on other than the Laurier database to cross reference login access for administrators and appointed moderators. </p>

        <h3>3.2 Functional Requirements  </h3>
        <dl>
        <dt>Each function description are divided into the following categories:</dt>
        <dl>
        <dd>Use Case Name – A description of the function preformed.</dd>
        <dd>Trigger – The action that causes the function to be performed.</dd>
        <dd>Precondition – The precondition(s) that have to be meet for the function to be performed.</dd>
        <dd>Basic Path – The website pages that appear or change based on the function preformed.</dd>
        <dd>Alternative Path – An alternative path that the website can preform to fulfill the functions desired result.</dd>
        <dd>Postcondition – The end result after the function is performed.</dd>
        <dd>Exception Paths – Actions that can cause the function to preform incorrectly and how the function deals with them accordingly.</dd>
        <dd>Other – Anything else that the function needs or occurs that needs clarification about its function.</dd>

            <dt>Other </dt>
            <dd>A moderator account cannot be accessed by multiple computers.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h4> Search UPOD: </h4>

        <dl>
            <dt>Use Case Name </dt>
            <dd>Search UPOD for specific topic. </dd>
            <dt>Trigger	 </dt>
            <dd>Request submitted via search bar. </dd>

            <dt>Other </dt>
            <dd>None. </dd>

        </dl>

        <h3>3.3 Security </h3>
        <p>UPOD requires a login and password for moderators and administrators. This login is cross referenced with the Laurier single sign on authentication, so that professors and other administrators can edit the 
            website, as well as appoint moderators and other administrators. </p>
