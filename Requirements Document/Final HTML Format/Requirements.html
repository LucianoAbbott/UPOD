            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            
            <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
            <p>UPOD is designed to make easier for student to access physics equations, definitions, explanations, and diagrams. As well as giving professors the ability of updating existing information, and adding new information.</p>
            
            <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>
            <p>The Undergraduate Physics Online Database (UPOD) is an online physics database targeted at university students and professors. It's user interface (UI) is designed to allow for easy access and updating. UPOD will give students the ability to learn about multiple physics topics, through the use of interactive diagrams, pictures, videos, equations, definitions, and explanations. Professors will be able to add to the students’ learning experience by creating and editing topic pages. The goal for UPOD is to make it accessible to everyone. This includes applying it to school servers, and have people login using their school login information.</p>

            <h2>2. Overall Description</h2>
            <p>UPOD is a self contained encyclopedia based web site that will supply users with information regarding physics. Because of the large amount of topics and information that physics covers the site will have to be easily navigable and intuitive as well as informative. To ensure the site is informative a variety of tools for page creation will be implimented to allow for the organization of information such as page sections, categorization and interactive diagrams.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
            <p>The UPOD site is to be self contained supplying its own front and back end. However, UPOD will be integrated into a Laurier Service as to utilize the Single Sign On authentication service provided by idp.wlu.ca. UPOD will host full support for the following browsers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firefox 28</li>
                <li>Chrome 21</li>
                <li>Safari 6.1</li>
                <li>Opera 12.1</li>
                <li>MS Edge 11</li>
            </ul>
            <p>UPOD's user interface will run almost exclusively for desktop computers with some, to no, support for mobile browsers.</p>            
            <h3>2.2 Define Product Functions</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Navigation</dt>
                    <dd>UPOD will be navigable using a series of categorical links and a search bar. Categorical based navigation will be based on a hierarchical tree structure implimented by assigning categories to pages.</dd>
                <dt>Search</dt>
                    <dd>UPOD will use bots to find and index key terms from the title and body of articles. key terms are compared to the frequency of word use and if under a certain treshold will be indexed.</dd>
                <dt>Pages </dt>
                    <dd>Pages will have a title, categories, sections, sub sections, formulas and diagrams. </dd>
                <dt>Moderator Functions</dt>
                    <dd>Moderators will be able to create, delete and edit pages. </dd>
                <dt>Admin functions</dt>
                    <dd>Administrators will be able to promote and revoke moderator status to a user.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <h3>2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>General Users</dt>
                    <dd>While UPOD is targeted at university students, a general user is not required to have Physics education or experience. It is assumed that they have basic technical knowledge and can navigate a website. They are able to traverse and read existing pages (and suggest new ones?) without creating an account.</dd>
                <dt>Moderators</dt>
                    <dd>A moderator has all of the privileges of a general user. They also require an account, which can be used to create, update, edit, and delete pages. Moderators should have greater physics and technical knowledge than a general user, as they have a greater degree of control over the website.</dd> 
                <dt>Administrators</dt>
                    <dd>An administrator has all moderator privileges, and can add moderators and administrators to the existing list. They also require an account, and should have the greatest degree of knowledge and experience.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>2.4 Constraints</h3>
            <p>Due to a lack of resources we will be unable to implement a separate mobile browser, causing our website not to be as functional off desktop browsers. </p>
            
            <h3>2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
            <p>The assumption is that any user will be accessible to anyone, where as our administrators and moderators will access from idp.wlu.ca to edit, create, delete and update pages. Not requiring our team to create a database or hashing or encrypting passwords.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Security </h3>
