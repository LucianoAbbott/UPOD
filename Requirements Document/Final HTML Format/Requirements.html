            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>UPOD is a web application that is designed to make the access of information, from the physics database, easier and more efficient for students. It will allow professors to customize topic pages by adding equations, explanations, definitions, and interactive diagrams. Professors will also be able to access the physics database itself, and update the stored information.</p>
            
            <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this document is to display the required components that are required to make application.</p>
            
            <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>
            <p>UPOD is an online physics database targeted at university students and professors. The application's UI is designed to allow for easy access and updating. UPOD will give students the ability to explore multiple physics topics, through the use of interactive diagrams, pictures, videos, equations, definitions, and explanations. Professors will be able to add to the studentsâ€™ learning experience by creating and editing topic pages.</p>
            <p>The goal for UPOD is to make it accessible to everyone. This includes ****</p>

            <h2>2. Overall Description</h2>
            <p>UPOD is a self contained encyclopedia based web site that will supply users with information regarding physics. Because of the large amount of topics and information that physics covers the site will have to be easily navigable and intuitive as well as informative. To ensure the site is informative a variety of tools for page creation will be implimented<!-- Misspelled Word: "implemented" --> to allow for the organization of information such as page sections, categorization and interactive diagrams.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
            <p>The UPOD site is to be self contained supplying its own front and back end. However, UPOD will be integrated into a Laurier Service as to utilize the Single Sign On authentication service provided by idp.wlu.ca. UPOD will host full support for the following browsers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firefox 28</li>
                <li>Chrome 21</li>
                <li>Safari 6.1</li>
                <li>Opera 12.1</li>
                <li>MS Edge 11</li>
            </ul>
            <p>UPOD's user interface will run almost exclusively for desktop computers with some, to no, support for mobile browsers.</p>            
            <h3>2.2 Define Product Functions</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Navigation</dt>
                    <dd>UPOD will be navigable using a series of categorical links and a search bar. Categorical based navigation will be based on a hierarchical tree structure implimented<!-- Misspelled Word: "implemented" --> by assigning categories to pages.</dd>
                <dt>Search</dt>
                    <dd>UPOD will use bots to find and index key terms from the title and body of articles. key<!-- Capitalize: "Key" --> terms are compared to the frequency of word use and if under a certain treshold<!-- Misspelled Word: "threshold" --> will be indexed.</dd>
                <dt>Pages </dt>
                    <dd>Pages will have a title, categories, sections, sub sections, formulas and diagrams. </dd>
                <dt>Moderator Functions</dt>
                    <dd>Moderators will be able to create, delete and edit pages. </dd>
                <dt>Admin functions<!-- Capitalize: "Functions" --></dt>
                    <dd>Administrators will be able to promote and revoke moderator status to a user.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <h3>2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>General Users</dt>
                    <dd>While UPOD is targeted at university students, a general user is not required to have physics education or experience. It is assumed that a general user has basic technical knowledge and can navigate a website. They are able to traverse, read, and suggest new pages without creating an account.</dd>
                <dt>Moderators</dt>
                    <dd>A moderator has all of the privileges of a general user. They also require an account, which can be used to create, update, edit, and delete pages. Moderators should have a basic knowledge of physics and greater technical knowledge than a general user, as they have a greater degree of control over the website. Programming knowledge is not mandatory, however, if they wish to create an interactive diagram, the moderator must know javascript.</dd> 
                <dt>Administrators</dt>
                    <dd>An administrator has all moderator privileges, and can add moderators and administrators to the existing list. Administrators also require an account, and should have the greatest degrees of physics knowledge and technical experience.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>2.4 Constraints</h3>
            <p>Due to a lack of resources we will be unable to implement a separate mobile browser, causing our website not to be as functional off desktop browsers. </p>
            
            <h3>2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
            <p>The assumption is that any user will be accessible to anyone, where as our administrators and moderators will access from idp.wlu.ca to edit, create, delete and update pages. Not requiring our team to create a database or hashing or encrypting passwords.</p>
