        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p> UPOD (University Physics Online Database) is a comprehensive online database designed to organize information pertaining to fundamental physics concepts, and present them in a straightforward, efficient manner for user retrieval. UPOD reduces the need to search through multiple sites and provides users a central location for reliable data. 
This analysis document formalizes the parameters determined for the project in its requirements plan, and refines in greater detail and scope the objectives of UPOD. In addition to the project's objectives, project specifications are articulated with clarity and concision to better remove uncertainty concerning any of the project's faculties during the design and implementation phases. 
It is presented in HTML format with UML diagrams. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="purposes_and_uses">2. Purposes and Uses</h2>
        <p> The purpose of this document is to provide an in-depth analysis of the project beyond the initial requirements phase, as it is a basis for the design document as well as for the project. The class, use case, and sequence diagrams are used 
in conjunction with object-oriented design to create a starting point for project development. </p>

        <h2 id="definitions">3. Definitions </h2>
        <ul>
			<li><b>Actor</b> - Any user (such as general users, administrators, moderators). </li>
			<li><b>Boundary Object</b> - Represents the system with actors which interact with other actors. Forms, windows, notices and messages are included. </li>
			<li><b>Behaviour Diagram</b> - A type of diagram that models a system's operations through the functions of its components. </li>
			<li><b>Class Diagram</b> - A structure diagram that outlines all classes, methods and attributes used in the project as well as their relationships. </li>
			<li><b>Control Object</b> - Coordinates boundary and entity objects. Created at the beginning of a use case, and ceases to exist afterwards. </li>
			<li><b>Entity Object</b> - Represents persistent, immutable information which form the core of the model. Often identified by nouns. </li>
			<li><b>Interaction Diagram</b> - A type of diagram that models how system elements affect and influence each other. </li>
			<li><b>Sequence Diagram</b> - An interaction diagram that shows how objects interact with each other in the temporal context of events. </li>
			<li><b>Structural Diagram</b> - A type of diagram that models the anatomy and architecture of a program. </li>
			<li><b>UML</b> - Unified Modeling Language. The basis for all diagrams used in this document. </li>
			<li><b>Use Case</b> - A method or action between two actors, connected through a communication (which is represented by a straight line). </li>
			<li><b>Use Case Diagram</b> - A behaviour diagram illustrated with actors and use cases, with communications between them to display their relationships. </li>
